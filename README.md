Aquaponics is a cultivation and growing method that raises edible fish and vegetables simultaneously without soil, using natural bacterial cycles to convert the fish waste into plant fertilizer while also conserving water.

* [Passive Hydroponics v.1.0](https://github.com/OikoSol/Food/blob/master/Passive%20Hydroponics%20v.1.0.pdf)

Hydroponics is a cultivation and growing method that cultivates vegetables without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions while also conserving water.

# Target Technologies

In this category, I will list some of the technologies that can produce food (both vegetable and animal) in an urban environment with limited space available.

* **Permaculture (in pots)**: Permaculture is a cultivation method which applies low impact techniques in order to grow vegetables without the use of pesticides, herbicides, additional soil fertilizer and reduces waste streams.
* **Hydroponics**: Hydroponics is a cultivation method which doesnâ€™t require soil and uses a nutrient-rich water solution to promote plant growth. It also conserves water compared to traditional soil-based cultivation methods.
* **Bioponics**: Bioponics is a cultivation method similar to hydroponics, but using an organic nutrient solution which can be commercial or derived from composting methods.
* **Aquaponics**: Aquaponics is a cultivation and growing method that raises edible fish and vegetables simultaneously without soil, using natural bacterial cycles to convert the fish waste into plant fertilizer while also conserving water.
